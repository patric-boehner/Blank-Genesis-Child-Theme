<h1 id="blankgenesischildtheme">Blank Genesis Child Theme</h1>

<p><strong>Github project link:</strong> https://github.com/patric-boehner/Blank-Genesis-Child-Theme/</p>

<p>This is the second version of my personal blank starter theme for use as a child of the <a href="http://www.studiopress.com/">Genesis Framework</a>. You are welcome to use this but be aware it is set up with my preferences and opinion in mind. The child theme uses <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> to compile and minify the JS and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS &amp; SCSS</a>. Your welcome to use any development tool you like, just delete the CodeKit files and take a look at the file organization to compile files correctly.</p>

<p>Tested up to WordPress version 5.0.3 and Genesis version 2.8.1.</p>

<h2 id="corefunctionalityplugin">Core Functionality Plugin</h2>

<p>All website functions that should be independent of the theme should be laced in the theme&#8217;s accompanying Core Functionality Plugin. Most often this includes custom post types, custom taxonomies, custom widgets, and custom meta boxes.</p>

<h2 id="opinionatedchanges">Opinionated Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is no Genesis Theme Settings page. Studiopress is doing away with this page at some point in the future so why not help them along.
-&gt; /inc/admin/genesis-metaboxes.php</li>
<li>All Genesis theme settings options have been removed except update notifications. This can still be found in the customizer.
-&gt; /inc/admin/customizer.php</li>
<li>All in post setting have also been removed, with the exception of archive headings and descriptions.
-&gt; /inc/admin/genesis-metaboxes.php</li>
<li>All Genesis built in widgets have been removed, along with most core widgets.
-&gt; /inc/admin/widgets.php</li>
<li>Using the new genesis configuration API</li>
<li>Supports Gutenberg with frontend and editor styles.</li>
<li>Some Gutenberg blocks have been disabled by default.
-&gt; /inc/admin/editor.php</li>
<li>The theme includes LazyLoading that can be activated in customizer. The lazy loading function comes from the wprig project.
-&gt; https://github.com/wprig/wprig</li>
<li>The theme uses CSS progressive loading along with the Filamont Group LoadCSS polyfill. The progressive loading function comes from the wprig project.
-&gt; /inc/functions/resource-loading.php</li>
<li>The theme uses async and defer JS loading. The progressive handling comes from the wprig project.
-&gt; /inc/functions/resource-loading.php</li>
<li>Social share links and a cookie based top banner can be activated in customizer.
-&gt; /inc/admin/customizer/partials</li>
<li>Uses CSS Grid with float and percentage based fallback for the content area.</li>
<li>The CSS has been simplified and all media queries have been moved inline.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fileorganization">File Organization</h2>

<h3 id="corefiles">Core Files</h3>

<p>Functions.php mainly pulls in all the files within the include folder. It also defines the child theme and setups the cache busting function used on sites with wp_debug() on.</p>

<pre><code>config/
	| - # All the changes to Genesis config settings. Seperates them out and keeps the inc/theme-setup.php file clean.
inc/
	| - admin		# All changes that affect the admin area or default theme settings loaded in functions.php.
	| - functions		# Collection of functions that are applied global and don't fit within a default template
	|			  file loaded in functions.php.
	| - partials		# Collection of individual template parts used within the structure files or default template files.
	| - structure		# Functions that directly relate to changes to the structure or the default templates files.
	|			  This borrows from how Genesis organizes some of its files.
	| - views		# Seperated html to keep code dry.
	| - theme-assets.php # Deals with loading all CSS &amp; JS asset files.
	| - theme-defaults.php # Sets the defaults for all Genesis config settings.
	| - theme-setup.php 	# Setup of most Genesis specific filters and theme support options.
</code></pre>

<h3 id="sassorganization">Sass Organization</h3>

<p>The core elements of the stylehseet can be found within the <code>_partials</code> folder. These partial files get pulled into the style sheets at the base of the <code>src-sass</code> folder.</p>
